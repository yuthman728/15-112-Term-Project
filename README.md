# 15-112-Term-Project
Super Mario Side Scroller TP

**Description:**

The project that I did was a side scroller, 2D Mario game that is very similar to Mario games that came out in the early 2000s. There are currently 2 levels, one normal level and one final level with a boss fight at the end. The players score and health are being kept track of at the top of the screen, and there is a "High Score" feature included when you beat the game. On the start screen, you can find the rules menu or the "start game" button, and during the first level of the game, you can press "p" to pause. You will constantly take damage when standing within an enemies hit box, and they will be aggressive to you when you are within a certain range. The map is also randomly generated with different terrains, gaps, enemies, and platforms. The final boss takes you out of the side scroller mode and locks you to one screen where you can move freely around the room.

**How to run:**

The user will open the "SuperMarioSSFinal" file in the same location as the "cmu_112_graphics.py" file, which will both be in the main game folder. The user should then open up the Images/Music folder using the terminal (use "cd" command to get to Image/Music) and can then run the "SuperMarioSSFinal" file.
